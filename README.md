# tockencardweb
TokenCard Website

This is the code for the TokenCard.io Website.

You can run the website locally in a simple way by using nodejs and gulp

First clone the repo, then just run the following from inside the main project directory:

```bash
npm install
gulp
```

Now you can see the website on http://localhost:8080

While the gulp task is running, changes made to SASS files, files in the '/js' directory, or to html files will cause the browser to reload automatically.
